# SharpSvn
SharpSvn is a facade for SharpSvn.1.8-x86, SharpSvn.1.8-x64, SharpSvn.1.9-x86, ...  to run on 32 and 64 bit and with different client versions. 

Your app can run on 32 and 64 bit systems and operate on any checkout independent of the client version it was made with.

Currently only a small set of methods are implemented. Ask me if you need more.
